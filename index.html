            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Levi Mendyk, I am 29 years old and I live in Denver, CO. I grew up in Nebraska where I received my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration and a Minor in Marketing/Management. I used to work in Government Affairs for 7-Eleven Inc. where I was a Legislative Analyst. My primary duties were to track and report state legislation across the entire U.S. and then coordinate this information to the Regional Managers. I have since left that position to pursue a career in Web Development. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Developement program through the University of Denver.  After this class I would like to find a full-time entry-level position to further my education and experience within this field.</p>

                <h2>Work</h2>
                    <p>Currently I have studied HTML and Advanced CSS. My first week's challenge we had to clean up the code using semantic HTML and combined CSS code so it was easier to read.

                    My next program to master is JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After JavaScript I will dive into other programs that are popular in today's workforce.
