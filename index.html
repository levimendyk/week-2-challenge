            <section class="about-me"><h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Levi Mendyk, I am 29 years old and I live in Denver, CO. I grew up in Nebraska where I received my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration and a Minor in Marketing/Management. I used to work in Government Affairs for 7-Eleven Inc. where I was a Legislative Analyst. My primary duties were to track and report state legislation across the entire U.S. and then coordinate this information to the Regional Managers. I have since left that position to pursue a career in Web Development. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Developement program through the University of Denver.  After this class I would like to find a full-time entry-level position to further my education and experience within this field.</p>

                    <p>Currently I have studied HTML and Advanced CSS. My first week's challenge we had to clean up the code using semantic HTML and combined CSS code so it was easier to read.
